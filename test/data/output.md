the longer term, to reintegrate a territorially intact Iraq as a law‑abiding member 
of the international community.”[^1] 

1.  The policy of containment was seen as the “only viable way” to pursue those 
objectives. A “policy of trying to topple Saddam would command no useful international 
support”. Iraq was unlikely to accept the package immediately but “might be persuaded 
to acquiesce eventually”.

2.  After prolonged discussion about the way ahead, the UN Security Council adopted 
resolution 1284 in December 1999, although China, France and Russia abstained.2 

3.  The resolution established:

*  a new inspectorate, the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection 

 *  internecine violence;
 *  terrorism; and 
 *  Iranian interference. 

Commission (UNMOVIC) (which Dr Hans Blix was subsequently appointed 
to lead); 

*  a timetable to identify and agree a work programme; and
*  the principle that, if the inspectors reported co‑operation in key areas, that would 

lead to the suspension of economic[^3] sanctions. 

4.  Resolution 1284 described Iraq’s obligations to comply with the disarmament 
standards of resolution 687 and other related resolutions as the “governing standard 
of Iraqi compliance”; and provided that the Security Council would decide what was 
required of Iraq for the implementation of each task and that it should be “clearly defined 
and precise”. 

5.  The resolution was also a deliberate compromise which changed the criterion for 
the suspension, and eventual lifting, of sanctions from complete disarmament to tests 
which would be based on judgements by UNMOVIC on the progress made in completing 
identified tasks. 

6.  Iraq refused to accept the provisions of resolution 1284, including the re‑admission 
of weapons inspectors. Concerns about Iraq’s activities in the absence of inspectors 
increased. 

7.  The US Presidential election in November 2000 prompted a further UK review of the 
operation of the containment policy (see Section 1.2). There were concerns about how 
long the policy could be sustained and what it could achieve. 

8.  There were also concerns over both the continued legal basis for operations in the 
No‑Fly Zones (NFZs) and the conduct of individual operations.4

9.  In an Assessment on 1 November, the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) judged 
that Saddam Hussein felt “little pressure to negotiate over ... resolution 1284 because 
the proceeds of oil smuggling and illicit trade have increased significantly this year, and 
more countries are increasing diplomatic contacts and trade with Iraq”.5 

10.  The JIC also judged:

“Saddam would only contemplate co‑operation with [resolution] 1284, and the return 
of inspectors ... if it could be portrayed as a victory. He will not agree to co‑operate 
unless:
*  there is a UN‑agreed timetable for the lifting of sanctions. Saddam suspects 
*  he is able to negotiate with the UN in advance to weaken the inspection 

that the US would not agree to sanctions lift while he remained in power;

provisions. His ambitions to rebuild Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction 
programmes makes him hostile to intrusive inspections or any other constraints 
likely to be effective.

“Before accepting 1284, Saddam will try to obtain the abolition of the No‑Fly Zones. 
He is also likely to demand that the US should abandon its stated aim to topple the 
Iraqi regime.”

11.  In November 2000, Mr Blair’s “preferred option” was described as the 
implementation of 1284, enabling inspectors to return and sanctions to be suspended.[^6]

12.  In December 2000, the British Embassy Washington reported growing pressure 
to change course from containment to military action to oust Saddam Hussein, 
but no decision to change policy or to begin military planning had been taken by 
President Clinton.[^7] 

13.  The Key Judgements of a JIC Assessment in February 2001 included:

*  There was “broad international consensus to maintain the arms embargo 
at least as long as Saddam remains in power. Saddam faces no economic 
pressure to accept ... [resolution] 1284 because he is successfully 
undermining the economic sanctions regime.”

*  “Through abuse of the UN Oil‑for‑Food [OFF] programme and smuggling of 

oil and other goods” it was estimated that Saddam Hussein would “be able to 
appropriate in the region of $1.5bn to $1.8bn in cash and goods in 2001”, 
and there was “scope for earning even more”.
